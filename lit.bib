Similarly, inLactococcus lactis, 78% of ChiLl sites GCGCGTGoccur in the leading strand [41]. The information onChi sites for several bacteria is summarized in [42].However, the prevalence of Chi sites on the leadingstrand is not universal: e.g. it is much less pronouncedin the genome of Haemophilus influenzaewhere the Chi-like sites are GNTGGTGG andGSTGGAGG [43, 44]. Other oligonucleotides withclear biological effect and uneven distribution on theleading and lagging strands (around the dif site) areKOPS motifs GGGNAGGG directing the movementof the E. coli translocase FtsK [39, 45, 46].},

	quote = {Different classes of GC-skew behaviour__replication, genome, chromosome organization, gc skew__The ideal curve is -shaped when the chromosomalsequence starts at the oriC site (Figure 2A).If the sequence starts at an arbitrary point of thechromosome, the corresponding curve has oneminimum and one maximum (Figure 2B).The ordinates of the points at the beginning andthe end of the curve in the majority of cases areabout the same. If this is not the case, it would meaneither that the statistical properties of the replichoresare different (which is unlikely due to the inherentsymmetry of the genome) or, more likely, that thereplichores in the analyzed chromosome havedifferent lengths. Visually, this manifests in terCbeing not directly opposite to oriC in the circularrepresentation of the chromosome.Genomic rearrangements, in particular, inversions,create a mosaic of ancestral leading and laggingstrands and such genomes yield plots with multipleminima and maxima corresponding to the recombinationsites. The main criterion used to assign a genome toClass 2 is the presence of the global minimum,accompanied by additional local extrema, and,dependent on the intensity of recombinations, wesubdivide Class 2 further into Class 2A with fewrearrangements, expressed as several local extrema(Figure 3A) and Class 2B with multiple rearrangements,seen as multiple local extrema (Figure 3B).Class 3 contains genomes without a clear globalminimum in the GC-skew plots, and at the sametime these plots have several positions withapproximately equal minimal values. At that time,the Class 3A GC-skew plots have several localextrema (Figure 4A), whereas in Class 3B, the GCskewplots have multiple local extrema (Figure 4B).Naturally, the plot amplitudes for the GC-skewdepend on the class: the more rearrangementshave happened the smaller are the amplitudes. Theaverage amplitudes for different classes are presentedin Table 3.},
	quote = {GC-skew classes do not represent phylogenetic groups__replication, genome, chromosome organization, gc skew__Notably, according to our classification, chromosomesof numerous close relatives (species or strainlevel) may be assigned either to the same class, or todifferent classes. As an example, bacterial chromosomesof the Bacillus or Staphylococcus species areassigned to Class 1A. At the same time, bacterialchromosomes from the Burkholderia genus are distributedamong different classes. Most Burkholderiarepresentatives belong to Class 1A, among themBurkholderia mallei ATCC 23344 chromosome 2 andB. mallei NCTC 10247 chromosome II. At the sametime, B. mallei ATCC 23344 chromosome 1 andB. mallei NCTC 10247 chromosome I belong toClass 2A. Class 3A also contains representatives ofthis genus, B. mallei SAVP1 chromosome I andB. mallei NCTC 10229 chromosome I. The genusSynechococcus also is represented in all classes. Synechococcussp. WH8102 belongs to Class 1A, Synechococcussp. CC9311 and Synechococcus sp. CC9605 to class 2A,Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab to Class 2B, S. elongatusPCC 6301 to Class 3A, and Synechococcus sp.JA-2-3B’a(2–13) to Class 3B.},
	quote = {Method to identify DnaA boxes in bacteria__DnaA boxes, motifs, motif finding, algorithms, replication, oriC__For a taxon under analysis, the regions of thereplication initiation may be defined for genomesfrom Class 1 and 2A using the GC-skew plots andlocation of the dnaA gene. Over-represented motifsidentified in this region are likely DnaA-boxes. Thepositional weight matrix (PWM) may be derivedfrom these boxes and used to find clusters ofcandidate DnaA-boxes in the remaining genomesfrom this taxon.Two cautionary notes should be made at thispoint. First, in chromosomes of likely plasmid origin,such as chromosome II of Vibrio cholerae, the structureof the replication origin may be different from that ofthe bona fide bacterial chromosomes [100]. Second,clusters of the DnaA-boxes may occur not only atthe replication origins, but also in other loci. Forexample, the datA locus of E. coli contains a cluster ofthe DnaA-boxes that are involved in the regulationof replication initiation, more exactly, control ofover-initiation [101, 102].},

	quote = {Die bisher gängige Null-Hypothese für Motiv-Überrepräsentation I__motifs, assessment of motif prevalence__The critical point is that over- or under-representation is by definitionrelative to the so called null-model. The most common approach is to calculate the occurrence of submotifsand from that derive the likelihood of them to form the motif itself. The logic is that if there are,for example, many GA and TC dinucleotides in a sequence the chance of a GATC would increase.The expected incidence of GATC is relative to the number of GAs and TCs. Thus, a single occurrenceof GATC in a region with many GAs and TCs would not be considered an over-representation.Conversely, in a region in which the only GA and TC dinucleotides formed a GATC motif, thisincidence would be considered an over-representation. The problem with this approach is that it doesnot take into account the rules and constraints that might apply to biological sequences.},
	quote = {Die bisher gängige Null-Hypothese für Motiv-Überrepräsentation II__motifs, assessment of motif prevalence, algorithms__For a biological meaningful evaluation of motif abundance it is important to apply a null-model todistinguish between conspicuous accumulations of motifs and those arising by chance. Previous nullmodelswere based on Markov-chains of different order. Markov-chains take base neighbourhooddependencies of nucleotide occurrence throughout the genome into account. However, chromosomalDNA is highly diverse. Using the complete chromosomal DNA sequence merges coding and noncodingDNA characteristics in the process of sequence k-mer frequencies determination. Especiallythe non-coding DNA is highly diverse due to its manifold roles for transcription determination (e.g.promoter sequences, terminators and other regulatory sites). Hence, a one-fits-all approach is notrecommended to perform reliable motif analysis.},
	quote = {Motivation für DistAMo-Algorithmus__motifs, assessment of motif prevalence, algorithms, DistAMo__We therefore concentrate on the coding sequencefor two reasons. First of all, it is the dominating sequence type in bacteria, covering approximately90% of the total chromosomal DNA sequence. Secondly, there is a single principle, the coding forproteins, dominating the evolution of this type of sequence. This allows the coding information of thesequence to be used as null model for the calculation of motif abundance. Such an approach wouldthus focus on the biological constraints of a sequence rather than on its pure statistics. We thereforepropose the DistAMo (Distribution Analysis of DNA Motifs) algorithm that estimates the motifdistribution by the coding flexibility of the protein encoding DNA (Figure S1).},

The GATC overrepresentationpeaked symmetrically at approximately one third of the distance to the terminus regionon both replichores (Figure 6A). [...] Our analysis revealed the conservation ofthe symmetric high-density regions found for E. coli in Dam positive γ-proteobacterial chromosomes(Figure 6B). In contrast, an even distribution of GATCs without distinct cluster patterns was observedfor Dam negative chromosomes (Figure 6C). These findings suggest that the chromosome-widedistribution of GATCs is directly linked to the presence of dam on the respective genome.},

	quote = {Genes beside oriC are enriched in GATC sequences__GATC, E. coli, Gammaproteobacteria, oriC, Dam__GATC sequences can be found with a high frequency in the origin of replication of Escherichia coli,reflecting the importance of GATC methylation for the proper function of oriC. Zooming into our GATCdensity analysis of coding regions near the origin shows an over-representation of GATCs directlyadjacent to the oriC (Figure 6D). To investigate if this over-representation is conserved we analysedthe genes neighbouring the origin in both Dam positive and negative sets of γ-proteobacteriadescribed above (Figure 6E and F). Both genes directly neighbouring the replication origin show asignificant over-representation of GATCs with mean z-score values of 3.3 and 1.8, respectively. Thus,the GATC over-representation found at the replication origin includes the coding regions of adjacentgenes (Figure 6E). Notably, this finding applies only to bacteria encoding a Dam homolog while noGATC enrichment was found for origin-neighbouring genes in genomes of Dam-negative bacteria(Figure 6F).},
	quote = {Genes involved in DNA replication and repair are enriched in GATCs__GATC, E. coli, replication__In Escherichia coli, several other genes, in addition to the oriC-flanking genes, show a strongenrichment of GATC sites in their coding sequences. We asked whether these genes are functionallyrelated and investigated COG (conserved orthologous gene) groups comprising E. coli genesbelonging to the same functional class. Application of DistAMo provided z-scores for the overrepresentationof the GATC motif in these groups (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, the group of replication andrepair genes yielded the only significant (3.9) score of all groups (Figure 7A) with a large gap to thesecond highest score (1.2). To cross-check the gene group of replication and repair for the specificityof GATC over-representation we analysed the over-representation z-score of all tetramers in thisgroup (Figure 7B). Notably, GATC was most over-represented in this COG group among all 256tetramers (Figure 7B) further supporting the significance of our finding.},
